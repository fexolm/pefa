Parallel executors for Apache Arrow

Pefa is an aducational project, trying to implement query engine for apache arrow tables.
As MLIR seemed more reasonable apptoach to write query optimizer, than hand written visitors, this project was archived and new [arcise](https://github.com/fexolm/arcise) project was created.
